This is a personal project to make a drinking game where you press a button that makes a servo rotate to point at a person to make them drink.
There should be a way to select how many players there is when i decide to implement it.
The LCD-display also displays which player has to drink.
It is coded on an Arduino Uno and will have a printable case to house the Arduino and the other electronics.
The files for the case will come when I've designed it and have printed it to test the fits and toleranses.
I will most likely print the case with a Prusa mini with a 0.4mm nozzle.
